To create the software package:

I need to add (exactly these) files:
Chebfun3F folder (completely)
createPlots
rows.mat
testfunctionDataGenerator
testfunction
TestScriptMultipleFunctions (maybe)
TestScriptSingleFunction

I need a reference to download (and mention that these need to be on the Matlab path):
Chebfun package (https://www.chebfun.org)
Spinterp package (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330956911_Sparse_Grid_Interpolation_Toolbox_v511)

Do I need to add the Chebfun lizense?
